This repository includes the very basic Deep Learning modules (Logistic Regression - Plain Shallow Networks - Plain Deep Networks) in Python, for starters.

1. "Logis_Reg.py": Logistic Regression Model Generator and Predictor
	- All required helper functions
	- A comprehensive logistic regression model generator
	- NOTE: this function gets regular updats; for now, it only includes equations and computations for sigmoid non-linearity, additional non-linearities are to be added in the future
